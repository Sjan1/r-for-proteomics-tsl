1)  Fix the scripts from the last session, S03...

```
sampleNames(eprots) <- sample1
```

This needed to combine properly. For instance, set all acquisitions to the 
same sample name if they are different fractions from the same sample.

```
sampleNames(eprots1) <- sample1
sampleNames(eprots2) <- sample1
combine(eprots1, eprots2) ## will rbind (along the rows)
```

Sample names and feature names are important because they define how
the data can be combined. See the section in this vignette
https://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/articles/MSnbase-demo.html.

```{r}
library("MSnbase")
data(msnset)
fvarLabels(msnset)

## rename all feature variables
mA <- updateFvarLabels(msnset, "A")
fvarLabels(mA)

## remove 1 feature variable
fData(mA)$ms.level.A <- NULL
fvarLabels(mA)
```

Example:

- keep all the feature data at the peptide level, needed for filtering
- check if feature names need to be renamed before combining acquisitions
- remove some feature variables before combining into proteins (for example remove peptide scores)


2)  Another In Fix in spectral counting table in S02...

```
table(fData(msnset$accession$Value)
```

This happens because PSMs/peptides match to multiple proteins,
which are recorded as a list in the feature variable.

```{r}
load("data/td.rda")
```

`td` comes from rfp4 `S03`:

```
td <- as(msnid, "data.table")
msnset <- as(msnid, "MSnSet")
```

3)  In general we need to sometime combine some samples. All should
start by applying filters on the Sample-Experiment-Table (SEx table).
In this respect, Marielle has suggested following:

```
fn <- tab %>% group_by(biorep,sample,treatment,cleavage) %>%
  summarise(file = paste0(file, collapse="+"))
```
 

Using this pipe gives groups, where we want to combine fractions of
biosamples. Now we should work out how to incorporate this into our
scripts. I am not sure if I understand your suggestion at the very
bottom of script `S03-id.R`

We to counts peptides or spectra of proteins of individual samples
replicates of individual categories (of individual categories,
sometimes). And we should rely on the table as it contains all the
information already.

4)  When the previous is done, we can/need to add sample
meta-information to MSnSet. And then, at last, we should be able to
start plotting, right? Directly from MSnSet? How?

```
sampleNames(msnset)
tab[1:3, 1]

pd <- data.frame(tab[1:3, ])
rownames(pd) <- sampleNames(msnset)
pData(msnset) <- pd
```

5)  Mascot MzIdentML Export issue â€“ will it be fixed? A direct
comparison with MSGF+ would be very useful.

Yes, this is fixed, but still meed to be pushed to github.

Also spectra annotations
- in MSnbase, match observed and theoretical peaks
- read it from Mascot; do we have an mzid file with these? See issue
  173 in mzR.

6) Statstical analyses
- `msmsTests` for spectral counting - See `S01-msmsTests.R`.
- `DEP` for reporter ions

- `ProSTAR`

7)  Future meetings and collaboration
