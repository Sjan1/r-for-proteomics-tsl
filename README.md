## R and Bioconductor for proteomics at the Sainsbury Laboratory 



This repository will host the OpenPlant funded *R/Bioconductor for
proteomics* material. The funding was awarded to Jan Sklenar (TSL,
Norwich), Laurent Gatto (UCam), Marielle Vigouroux (JIC), Govind
Chandra (JIC) to introduce and implement the utilisation of
various
[R for proteomics](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/RforProteomics.html) tools
in the Sainsbury Laboratory and more generally on the Norwich campus.

The project will run 6 sessions/days over 6 months with the aim to

- Identify needs and opportunities
- Train invdividuals
- Dedicated development and integration with existing tools
