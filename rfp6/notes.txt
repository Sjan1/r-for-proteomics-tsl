# Notes on RfP6
---
## Scripts
## S00-env.R 
to load libraries

## code.R
- 1. reads experimenal table with data annotation
- 2. creates MSnSets of PSMs
- 3. creates MSnSets of unique peptides

## code_tets.R
for testing

## functions.R
- functions used in this project
- development and troubleshooring purpose
- eventually, if accepted, it should be moved to rtslprot

## core_prot.R
- making proteins from the peptide MSnSet created in code.R
- uses code.R output

## s03-tidy.R
tidy protein MSnSet creaded in code_prot.R data for ggplot2

## QC_plots.Rmd
- here we create summaries of a project
- for QC purposes and start data analusis
- is uses scripts from s03-tidy.R

## peptides.Rmd
to publish statistical testing results

## To do:
To do:

- function for fold changes (FC)
- compare msgf vs mascot
- subset peptide MSnSet to extract one protein (ideally like Similarity view in Scaffold), table of all the peptides that identifies a protein in all the samples
- we could make function for that from rfp6/S03_code_prot.R
