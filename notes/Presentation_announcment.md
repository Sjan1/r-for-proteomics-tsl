## Title: R for Proteomics

### Date: 11th March 2019

<br>
### Abstract:
The final presentation of OpenPlant project aimed to facilitate proteomics data analysis using the existing infrastructure in **R** environment. The objective to organize training and explore **R for Proteomics**, an open source project available in Bioconductor packages was met in several workshops with the developer. The generated code was applied to current JIC/TSL projects. We set up basic proteomics data pipeline that forms useful and independent alternative to our existing, mostly commercial tools. The results of this teamwork, experience working with the **R** packages and perspectives will be presented and discussed by team members. Refreshment will be provided.

<br> 
### Target audience:
Those who carry out proteomics experiments and seek a deeper understanding of data analysis involved and, those wishing to learn to use open source proteomics tools available in **Bioconductor**.
